# SolveIt
Rubik's Cube Scrambler

#TODO
DONE 1 - Fix the bug that moves are not showing the correct image
DONE 2 - Add a timer 
    -> At the end of the movements page, add a button to start the timer
    -> This button then fills the screen with a timer and a large button to stop the timer
    -> When the timer is stopped, the time is saved internally and the large screen goes back to the movements page 
DONE 3 - Add a profile page
    -> This page will have a list of all the times saved, with the best time highlighted
    -> This page will have a button to delete all the times
    -> This page will have a button to delete a specific time
    NOT DONE-> This page will have a graph of the times saved (last 10, last 20, last 50, last 100, all)
4 - Add a dark theme toggle
    -> This just changes the background color of the app in the movements page (including the timer) and the profile page
    -> Also changes the color of the cubes in the movements page
5- - Fix sound effect
